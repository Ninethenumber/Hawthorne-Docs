# The Laws of Lerwick (IC)

Lerwick is a city on the wild frontier. Its laws are a bit more harsh than most cities, but with its tendency to draw in powerful individuals, the laws must be equally strong. Recommended penalties are listed beside each tier of infraction. The final decision regarding punishment lies with the Council or a Judicial Representative they assign. Individuals may request a trial, and it will be overseen by either the Council or a Judicial Representative.
