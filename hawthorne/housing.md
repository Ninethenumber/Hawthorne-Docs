# General Rules

If you have proficiency or expertise in either carpenter's tools or mason's tools, you may reduce the downtime cost of construction of a house or rooms by **one quarter**.
This reduction does not additionally apply to subsequent downtime point usage, such as crafting in the Tool Workshop.

**The maximum size for a single room is 30ft by 30ft. This is doubled for rooms that occupy two room slots.**
