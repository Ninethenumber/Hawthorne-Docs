# Downtime

Downtime is considered days spent between your adventures. 

## Earning Downtime Points

You earn Downtime Points (DTP) at a rate of 5 days per 1 hour of any in-game session. If you don't make
 it to a full hour, you'll gain 2 days worth. Downtime points are shared between characters, and you don't lose any if one of your character dies.

*Note: DMs also gain full downtime days for sessions they run.*

## Using Downtime Points

You can use downtime points to perform certain tasks outside of sessions. You can use downtime points as any character you chose, however you cannot spend it for other people.

### Travel

You can travel to another city or location using downtime points. DTP represent the travel time it takes for you to get there. Currently, the only city you can travel to is Waterdeep. It takes 15 days to get there, and 15 to get back to Lerwick.

In Waterdeep, you can:

- Learn a language for 100DTP and 500GP (per language).
- Gain proficiency with a tool for 100DTP and 500GP (per tool).
- Gain expertise with a tool you're already proficient with for 50DTP and 250GP (per tool).

### Housing

You can also use your downtime points to construct buildings or enhance them. Please see the [Housing Docs](housing) for more details.

### Purchasing items

You can buy any non-magical item worth less than 200GP in Lerwick directly. For any item above 200GP, you will have to go [travel to Waterdeep](#travel).

### Crafting

You can use your DTP to craft items with tools you are proficient with. You can craft items for half the retail price of the item (as stated in the Player's Handbook). The amount of downtime points needed to craft an item is determined as follows: `Cost of Item / 25`. You have to have proficiency in the tool required to craft the item with. At the moment, you can only craft non-magical items and healing potions.

### Earning Gold

You can use downtime points to earn gold by providing your services to others. Spend any amount of downtime points and choose an artisan tool. 

- If you don't have proficiency in the tool you earn `1d6` per DTP.
- If you have proficiency in the tool, you earn `1d6+prof bonus` per DTP.
- If you have expertise in the tool, you earn `1d6+2*prof bonus` per DTP.

### Copying Spells

While copying spells, one DTP counts as 8 hours. Copying spells follows the rules outlined in the player's handbook. You cannot spend half a DTP, you always spend at least one (Round up).
